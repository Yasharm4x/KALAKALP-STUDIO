        KalaKalp, The Art studio, is a musical mission to promote, preserve, nurture and bloom the art and culture of our nation, that is, the conclusively rich-in-heritage Bharat.<br><br>
        Prayaas, literally meaning ‘effort’, is one such event diligently curated by its Director Manjiri Wathare.<br><br>
        Staying true to its ten-year long tradition, Prayaas has been instrumental in promoting, nurturing, and reveling in the affluence of Bhartiya culture by presenting giants from the fields of music and dance, alongside budding artistes. It is an exceptional combination of ‘old to not-so-old to the new, traditional to modern to contemporary’, showcasing the best of arts and music from all over the world.<br><br>
        In today’s times of transition when our nation is transforming drastically in all walks of life and heading towards being a developed nation, it becomes all the more significant to emphasize and highlight our roots. “Where we come from” forms a compact foundation for any big leap, giving a rock-solid base to rejoice in the rich and colorful reservoir of wisdom through art and culture. We must never have a myopic perspective; understanding the wide range of global music and dance allows us to imbibe a beautiful blend of sanskar in current and future generations.
