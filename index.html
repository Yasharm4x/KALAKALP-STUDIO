        KalaKalp, The Art studio, is a musical mission to promote, preserve, nurture and bloom the art and culture of our nation, that is, the conclusively rich-in-heritage Bharat.<br><br>
        Prayaas, literally meaning ‘effort’, is one such event diligently curated by its Director Manjiri Wathare.<br><br>
        Staying true to its ten-year long tradition, Prayaas has been instrumental in promoting, nurturing, and reveling in the affluence of Bhartiya culture by presenting giants from the fields of music and dance, alongside budding artistes. It is an exceptional combination of ‘old to not-so-old to the new, traditional to modern to contemporary’, showcasing the best of arts and music from all over the world.<br><br>
        In today’s times of transition when our nation is transforming drastically in all walks of life and heading towards being a developed nation, it becomes all the more significant to emphasize and highlight our roots. “Where we come from” forms a compact foundation for any big leap, giving a rock-solid base to rejoice in the rich and colorful reservoir of wisdom through art and culture. We must never have a myopic perspective; understanding the wide range of global music and dance allows us to imbibe a beautiful blend of sanskar in current and future generations.

      <div style="flex: 2; min-width: 280px;">
        <p>Mrs. Manjiri Chinmay Wathare was initiated into dance by Guru Archana Anuradha. Under her able guidance, she started her training at the age of nine. There she was also fortunate to seek blessings from Guru Lt. Madhurita Sarang. Thereafter, she continued under the tutelage of Guru Pandit Rajendra Gangani ji, a renowned Kathak maestro of the Jaipur Gharana and the torchbearer of its purest form. It is here that Manjiri learned the subtle and technical intricacies of Kathak dance.</p>
        <p>Manjiri has completed her “Nritya Visharad“ in Kathak from Akhil Bhartiya Gandharv Mahavidyalaya Mandal. She has also completed a Master's in Kathak from Nalanda Dance & Research Centre, Mumbai, and a Bachelor’s in Fashion–Apparel Design from SNDT University. She is a registered examiner at ABGMVM.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Manjiri Chinmay Wathare, founder of Kalakalp – The Art Studio, has skillfully taken up this responsibility with the blessings of Guru Pandit Shri Rajendra Gangani.</p>
        <p>Guruji, as Pandit Rajendra Gangani ji is fondly addressed, has not only been instrumental in blessing his disciples with vast practical knowledge but also in encouraging them to pass on this wisdom, thus creating a boundless hierarchy of Kathak.</p>
        <p>Taking a cue from his teachings, Kalakalp – The Kathak Studio – was established in January 2014.</p>
        <p>Manjiri has given many solo performances and has participated in numerous group compositions and choreographic pieces directed by leading Gurus like Pandit Rajendra Gangani ji himself, Smt. Rajshree Shirke, Shri Dhirendra Tiwari, and Archana Anuradha.</p>
